---COURSE SCHEDULE GENERATOR---

-ABOUT PROJECT-
Course Schedule Generator is a schedule preparation application. The
purpose of this application is to prepare easy lesson program under the desired
conditions. Special assignment can be made for the course scheduler. 

-ABOUT INTERFACE-
Since there is an interface that works without a database, what you choose is not saved.
The data displayed on the screen is considered to be entered by the user before.
Since the interface is not designed responsive, it may have a bad image on 
other devices (mobile, tablet, large screen). 

-HOW TO USE ?-
*Use the Chrome browserand laptop devices for the best view.*
You can login to the application with indexxx.html in the directory.
You just need to register to use the application. When you register with the 
school mail, the system will automatically create a teacher or course
program builder registration for you.
